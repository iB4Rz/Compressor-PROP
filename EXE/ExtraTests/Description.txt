This executable exists due to the rule "Tests que el grup ha fet servir per provar el seu projecte" in Normativa.pdf
We dont use any kind of file related tests since the completion of the first algorithm, instead we created a set of tests
that replace this files and operates in memory instead of disk with randomided files of different sizes.

ExtraTestsDriver.jar runs white box tests from FONTS/Testing/ExtraTests featuring LZ78,LZW,LZSS and Huffman
These are not unit tests, they only test the public procedures in every algorithm (compress/decompress) and dont
enforce retrocompatibility of the compressed files since this tests are meant to check the compression integrity after making changes etc.
